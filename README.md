## Project Description

- In this project, I've concentrated on refining my frontend development skills. The use of cutting-edge technologies allows for a seamless and engaging user experience. From user login simulations to reservation and payment processes, this project encapsulates various features to simulate a real-world tour page.

## Project Features
 
### User Session (Simulation)
- Implemented an interface simulation for users to log in.
- The simulation occurs solely on the frontend side, ensuring a smooth experience without interacting with a real user database.
### Detailed Tour Page
- Created a dedicated page displaying comprehensive tour information, including descriptions, dates, prices, and captivating images.
### Reservation and Payment Process (Simulation)
- Users can select a tour, make reservations, and simulate the payment process for a realistic user journey.
### Filtering
- Integrated options to filter the tour list based on criteria such as price and city, providing users with a tailored browsing experience.
- When filtering is applied, the filtered value is added to the page's URL using searchParams, and upon reopening the page with that URL, the filtering is re-applied.
### Search Functionality
- Implemented a search bar at the top right, allowing users to easily search for tours.
- Tours are dynamically filtered based on the letters entered, with matching results displayed below the search bar.
### Bookmarking
- Users can enjoy a personalized experience by bookmarking tours after logging in, adding a layer of customization and convenience to their journey.
